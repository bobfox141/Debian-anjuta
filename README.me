Introduction:
-------------

Anjuta DevStudio is a versatile Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
on GNOME Desktop Environment and features a number of advanced
programming facilities. These include project management, application and
class wizards, an on-board interactive debugger, powerful source editor,
syntax highlighting, intellisense autocompletions, symbol navigation,
version controls, integrated GUI designing and other tools.

Anjuta is an effort to marry the flexibility and power of text-based 
command-line tools with the ease-of-use of the GNOME graphical user 
interface. We thrive to make it very usable by eleminating developers
burden with mudane programming tasks.

Anjuta 2.x is the next generation Anjuta development studio with extensible
plugin architecture. The new architecture allows writing independent
plugins that could interact with existing plugins. Most of the older
features have been already ported to the new architecture and are working.

The new architecture has:

    * Complex docking shell that allows arbitrary docking of IDE widgets.
    * Dynamic plugin activation and deactivation.
    * Extensible architecture.
    * Plugins can interact with other plugins through interface.
    * Plugins can install dynamic UIs (menus/toolbars), including installing
	  context menus in other plugins.

At present, Anjuta is only a beta release and lots of work needs to be done to 
improve it. In the future, Anjuta is going to be much more capable and stable! 
Extensive debugging has not yet been performed, so at the moment it will 
undoubtedly have lots of bugs. It would be great if you use it and report any 
problems to us. That way, you will be helping to improve the software as well 
as helping the Open Source community. Please read the file COPYRIGHT for
details. 

Any sort of suggestions or patches for Anjuta are also most welcome.
