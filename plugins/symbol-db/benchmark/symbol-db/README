To have good performances tests you can run:

./populate-test-dir.sh

and then 

valgrind --tool=callgrind --collect-systime=yes  \
		 --callgrind-out-file=callgrind.out  ./.libs/benchmark test-dir


The former creates ./test-dir with all the sources of Anjuta and populate a db on
that directory.
The latter launches callgrind which enumerates a lot of data of the execution: 
functions call, timings, number of calls, etc.
